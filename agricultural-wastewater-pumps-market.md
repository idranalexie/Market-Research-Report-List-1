<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Wastewater Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-submersible</li><li>Submersible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural wastewater pumps market is categorized into two main types: non-submersible and submersible pumps. Non-submersible pumps are designed to operate above ground, using suction to draw water from a source, making them ideal for applications where accessing water at significant depths isn't necessary. Submersible pumps, on the other hand, are submerged directly in the wastewater, efficiently transporting water to the surface. Each type serves specific needs in agricultural settings, considering factors like depth, efficiency, and application requirements.</p></p>
