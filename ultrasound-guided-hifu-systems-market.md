<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasound-guided HIFU Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> Non-invasive Treatment</li><li>Minimal Invasive Treatment </li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasound-guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) systems are categorized into non-invasive and minimally invasive treatments. Non-invasive treatment utilizes focused ultrasound waves to target tissues without penetrating the skin, effectively abating tumors or promoting tissue regeneration while minimizing recovery time. In contrast, minimally invasive treatment may involve small incisions but still relies on ultrasound to guide the procedure, ensuring precision and enhancing patient outcomes. Both approaches offer targeted therapies with reduced complications compared to traditional surgical methods, making them increasingly popular in clinical settings.</p></p>
