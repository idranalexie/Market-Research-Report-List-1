<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Towing Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Towbar Tractors</li><li>Towbarless Tractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft towing equipment market primarily comprises towbar tractors and towbarless tractors. Towbar tractors connect to the aircraft via a towbar, allowing for precise maneuvering but requiring a specific attachment point on the aircraft. Conversely, towbarless tractors operate without a towbar, directly engaging the aircraft's main landing gear, offering greater operational flexibility and enhancing speed. Both types play crucial roles in ground handling, facilitating efficient aircraft movement during maintenance, repositioning, and servicing at airports.</p></p>
